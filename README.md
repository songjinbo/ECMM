# Rethinking Large-scale Pre-ranking System: Entire-chain Cross-domain Models

This repo is the official implementation for the [CIKM 2022 paper: *Rethinking Large-scale Pre-ranking System: Entire-chain Cross-domain Models*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3511808.3557683).

The paper is also available in [arxiv: *Rethinking Large-scale Pre-ranking System: Entire-chain Cross-domain Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08039)

## Dataset

Our released dataset ***JD.ad Pre-ranking*** could be found at [JD JingPan](http://box.jd.com/sharedInfo/FC5D1899151CF81DEEC946AFBC5707A7) with password `gj33tv`.

## Introduction

* *src/* : code including model structure and metric calculating

* *configure/* : configuration corresponding to each model

* *model/* : echo folder of which include offline metric such as auc, gauc and recall_rate(*metric_res.txt*). It's generated after train procedure finish

* *data/* : used to save train and test dataset

## Requirements

* conda 4.6.14
* python 3.6.13
* tensorflow 2.4.0
* scikit-learn 0.23.1

## Quick start

From [JD JingPan](http://box.jd.com/sharedInfo/FC5D1899151CF81DEEC946AFBC5707A7), download train dataset(named *train* folder) and test dataset(named *test* folder) into *data* folder.

```bash
sh run.sh
```
